Easy Call AI is a desktop AI assistant for real daily computer work.  
It is not trying to be just another chat website. The goal is simple: press one hotkey, call AI to your screen, solve the task, and move on.

## Why This Exists

Most AI tools are powerful, but daily usage still has friction:

- Too much context switching between browser tabs and apps
- Model/provider settings are scattered and hard to manage
- Conversations get messy and hard to review
- Workflow feels detached from the desktop environment

Easy Call AI is built to reduce that friction and make AI feel like a native desktop capability.

## Who It Is For

- People who ask AI questions while working on their computer
- Users managing multiple providers/models
- Users who prefer fast summon-and-hide workflow
- Users who want long-term conversation and memory continuity

## Core Features

- Global hotkey to show/hide chat window
- Tray mode (Config / Chat / Archives / Exit)
- Multiple LLM configurations
- Separate Chat AI and Vision AI configuration
- Tool calling (search / fetch / memory)
- Multiple personas
- Streaming replies and reasoning display
- Image paste and multimodal message storage
- Auto-archive conversations with archive viewer
- Memory import/export
- UI languages: Chinese / English / Japanese / Korean

## Typical Use Cases

- Ask about docs/errors/screenshots without leaving current workflow
- Switch models by task, without reconfiguring every time
- Keep long chats manageable via auto-archive
- Preserve useful preferences and context through memory
