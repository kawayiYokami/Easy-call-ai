Easy Call AI is a desktop AI assistant for real daily computer work.
It is not trying to be just another chat website. The goal is simple: press one hotkey, call AI to your screen, solve the task, and move on.

## Why This Exists

> Most AI tools are powerful, but daily usage still has friction:

| Pain Point | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Context Switching | Constantly switching between browser tabs and apps |
| Scattered Configs | Model and provider settings are hard to manage |
| Lost Conversations | Long chats become messy and hard to review |
| Detached Workflow | AI feels separate from the desktop environment |

**Easy Call AI** reduces that friction and makes AI feel like a native desktop capability.

## Who It Is For

- People who ask AI questions while working on their computer
- Users managing multiple providers and models
- Users who prefer a fast summon-and-hide workflow
- Users who want long-term conversation and memory continuity

## Core Features

- **Global Hotkey** — Show/hide chat window instantly
- **Tray Mode** — Config / Chat / Archives / Exit
- **Multiple LLM Configs** — Save multiple provider and model setups
- **Separate AI Modes** — Independent Chat AI and Vision AI settings
- **Tool Calling** — Search / Fetch / Memory

- **Streaming Replies** — Real-time response and reasoning display
- **Image Paste** — Multimodal message storage
- **Auto-Archive** — Traceable conversation history
- **Multilingual UI** — Chinese / English / Japanese / Korean

## Typical Use Cases
